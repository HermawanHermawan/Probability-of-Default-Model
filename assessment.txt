### ROC AND AUC CURVE
To assess the quality of the model, we will examine the ROC Curve(Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) and AUC Curve(Area Under The Curve).
The former is a graph showing the performance of a classification model at all classification thresholds. 
This curve plot two parameters, namely TPR(True Positive Rate) and FPR(False Positive Rate). 
A ROC curve plots TPR against FPR at different classification thresholds. 
Lowering the classification threshold classifies more items as positive, thus increasing both False Positive and True Positives. 
To compute the points in a ROC curve, we would evaluate a logistic regression model many times with different classification thresholds.
This would be however inefficient. Fortunately, there is an efficient, sorting-based algorithm that can provide this information for us, called AUC. 
AUC measures the entire two-dimensional area underneath the entire ROC Curve from (0,0) and (1,1). 
The AUC for predicting by chance is 50%. Accordingly, we can calculate AUC for the model as well. In our case, it is about 72% signifying a fair result.
